This logo describes the creative base-modules in the study-course Media & Interaction Design.
The base-modules consist of three different Modules
- Drawing and Sketching Basics
- Design Basics - Form and Composition
- Basic Design Skills - Systems and Processes

The goal was to create a logo that adjusts based on ever-changing and calculatable variables of the courses in abstract form. 
Taken variables are the amount of present students in a course as well as the temperatur in the room.
If no input for the variable is given, the logo has a "default-fallback" to black, which can also be used on print-media.
